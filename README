This is for development of standards-track RFCs for 9P.  At the present 
3 RFC drafts are planned:

	9P1 		- documenting classic 9P (TODO)
	9P2000 		- current 9P2000 standard
	9P2000.u 	- unix extensions to 9P2000
	9P2010		- proposed 9P2010 standard with extensions

People interested in helping write these suckers should look at
RFC2223 (Instructions to RFC Authors) and RFC2360 (Best Current Practices).
